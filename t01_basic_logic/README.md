# Topic 1: Basic Logic

A Basic of all mathematical reasoning and all automated reasoning. The rules of logic specify the meaning of mathematical statements. These rules help us understand the meaning of statements.

## Propositional Logic

A proposition is a statement that is either true or false, but not both. Consider declarative sentences for which it is meaningful to assign either of two status values: true or false.

example:

- "The sky is blue." (true)
- "The sun is black." (false)
- ${2 + 2 = 4}$ (true)

## Predicate Logic

A predicate is a verb phrase template that describes a property of objects or a relationship among objects represented by the variables

Predicates are often given a name that can represent the predicate

Quantifiers allow statements about entire collections of objects so that enumerating each object by name is not necessary.

- The universal quantifier is denoted by the symbol $\forall x$ and is read as "for all" or "for every". It is used to express that a predicate is true for all elements in a given domain.

- The existential quantifier is denoted by the symbol $\exists x$ and is read as "there exists" or "there is at least one". It is used to express that a predicate is true for at least one element in a given domain.

example:

- "The flower is Red." the template is Red, the variable is flower because red is a property of the flower.

- $\forall x Tigger(x) \rightarrow Mammal(x)$ (true)

- $\exists x Tigger(x) \rightarrow ManEater(x)$ (true)
